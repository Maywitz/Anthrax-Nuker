This bot will not work without the following required permissions :
- Ban Members
- Manage Server
- Manage Roles
- Manage Channels
- At this point just give it admin for obvious reasons... 
- This bot cannot ban members that have a higher role than it, nor can it delete roles higher than it, so make sure to drag it's role to the higehst you can
